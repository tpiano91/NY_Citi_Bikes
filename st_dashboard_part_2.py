    ### First Paragraph of Text
    
    st.markdown("There is an obvious correlation between the rise and drop of temperatures and their relationship with the frequency of bike trips taken daily. As temperatures plunge, so does bike usage. This insight indicates that the shortage problem may be prevalent merely in the warmer months, approximately from May to October. Below are more specific initial insights:")
   
    ### Insight 1

    st.markdown("1. There are noticeable points of drops in bike usage. The first in early October; followed by a more signifcant drop in mid-November, and again in mid-December (into the holiday season). ")

    ### Insight 2

    st.markdown("2. There are individual days of particularly low bike-usage that don't seem to correlate with temperature. The two lowest days for bike usage in 2022 are January 29th (a Saturday) and December 25th. Other noticeably low-use days (in relation to their particular time period) are March 12th (Saturday), May 7th (Saturday), September 6th (Tuesday), and October 3rd (Monday). Further research recommended to find reason for these 'isolated dips.'")
    
    ### Insight 3

    st.markdown("3. There are noticeable points of rises in bike usage in mid-February, mid-March and mid-April. Peak usage is reached in May and is sustained until October.")

'Hub 1' around in the area of Hoboken Terminal and Yards/Stevens Institute of Technology (parallel to the Meatpacking District in Manhattan); 'Hub 2' south (slightly west of what is labeled Downtown Jersey City); and smaller 'Hub 3' furhter west (near Indian Square). I will focus my insights mostly on Hub 1 and 2. There is also a much smaller Hub 4 in downtown Jersey City, by the water (parallel to Battery City Park in Manhattan).")

The most popular routes in Hub 1 flow to and from these four centralized stations")

")

    st.markdown("- To ensure that bikes are consistently available at the most popular locations, further analysis is necessary to identify specific times of day when these stations predominantly serve as either origin or destination points. During periods when they function primarily as origin stations, it may be important to ensure that an adequate supply of bikes is maintained by replenishing the stock frequently. Conversely, when these stations act as key destinations, efforts should be focused on clearing returned bikes quickly to free up docking space and redistribute them to areas with higher demand for departures.
